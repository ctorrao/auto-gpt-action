# Auto-GPT GitHub Action

This [Github Action][] uses [Auto-GPT][] to follow instructions in the issue description.

As per the example below, your workflow should be configured to only run the job containing this action under certain conditions, such as when a new label "auto-gpt" is added to an issue.

## Inputs

### `openai_key`

**Required** The OpenAI API key.

### `issue_body`

**Required** The body of the issue.

### `issue_number`

**Required** The number of the issue.

## Usage

To use the `auto-gpt.yml` workflow file, follow these steps:

1. Add the `OPENAI_KEY` secrets to your repository.
2. Add the following code to your `.github/workflows/auto-gpt.yml` file as below.
3. Create a new issue and label it with the `auto-gpt` label.

There is an example of how to use this action in [`.github/workflows/auto-gpt.yml`](https://github.com/nalbion/auto-gpt-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/auto-gpt.yml).

Auto-GPT env variables such as `FAST_TOKEN_LIMIT`, `MEMORY_BACKEND` etc should be able to be defined in your workflow yaml.

```yaml
name: Auto-GPT

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  resolve-issue:
    if: "contains(github.event.label.name, 'auto-gpt')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run Auto-GPT
      uses: nalbion/auto-gpt-action@master
      with:
        openai_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}
        issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
        issue_body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
```

## Notes from the human

This project was my first exposure to [Auto-GPT][], the idea was that it would be neat if Auto-GPT could automatically implement new features and/or fix bugs, just by tagging the issue with `auto-gpt`.

Inspiration for parts of the solution was drawn from the [gpt-developer](https://github.com/skaramicke/gpt-developer) action.

All of the code in this repository was generated by [Auto-GPT][] based off the prompts in `ai_settings.yaml`. Auto-GPT was _not_ run in continuous mode, infact there was a very lengthy discussion guiding Auto-GPT through the whole process.

| No, you will not (do something I had to tell it not to do several times), your next step will be ...

### Getting started with Auto-GPT
- [your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- To use OpenAI API key for Auto-GPT, you NEED to have a [paid account](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview).
- **Important**: It's highly recommended that you track your usage on the [Usage page](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)
  You can also set limits on how much you spend on the [Usage limits page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits).

- Edit `Auto-GPT/.env` (and add it to your `.gitignore` file!!):
```.dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
EXECUTE_LOCAL_COMMANDS=True
```

```bash
docker pull significantgravitas/auto-gpt:0.2.2 
copy ai_settings.yaml %USERPROFILE%\auto_gpt_workspace
copy auto-gpt.json %USERPROFILE%\auto_gpt_workspace
docker run -it --env-file=./Auto-GPT/.env -v "%USERPROFILE%/auto_gpt_workspace:/home/appuser/auto_gpt_workspace" significantgravitas/auto-gpt:0.2.2 --ai-settings auto_gpt_workspace/ai_settings.yaml
```
